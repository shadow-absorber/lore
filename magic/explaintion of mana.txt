mana flows through most creatures via their nervous system
exiting through the end points of where the nerves are./ nerve endings
the closer to the skin(outside of the body they are) the easier it is to release the mana from there. making fingers and toes the optimal spots
special training is required to be able to control the flow of mana through ones body to be able to release it from the more none obvious locations like the head

if a person uses up their entire mana reserve it will tap into their life force instead
doing that often leaves the person mana impareid(meaning they can't use mana anymore)

for some rare people mana flows into them when they use magic instead of out of them... if those people overcharge on mana they litrealy explode in most cases

mana is a dangerous tool to be controlled as if the purpose you use the mana for is not clear enough a lot of bad side effects might ocur
for example:
headaches
lose of senses
death of extrimites
mana impariety
